desc: Journey Maps are a tool used to discover how a user will interact with your project before building anything.  They can also be used to uncover pain points with existing projects. This is an exercise in roleplay with your personas.  Walk your persona through a task they need to complete that involves your project.

## Why use or do it:

We use journey maps to come up with a list of requirements for our project and uncover hidden issues. It's a way of brainstorming that is focused on user experience and forces the team to empathsize with your users.

## Whoâ€™s involved:

Designers and stakeholders. These should be done collaboratively. The bonus of collaborating and working openly is that there is a shared understanding and valuable conversations that arrive through the process of co-authoring the journey maps.

They can also be done solo as an exercise to work through design issues.

## When to use it:

Journey maps are created after you've made personas for your project. Use the personas to walk through that person having a task to do that involves your tool.

## Time commitment:

~ 1 hours per journey map

## How To:

### Supplies:

* Paper Template
* Notes from interviews
* Paper (sticky notes ok)
* Markers or Pen
* Slack channel


### Set Up:

#### If you are in the same room as design collaborators:

* Dedicate a room for the activity

#### If you are remote:

* Invite participants to join a Slack channel or some kind of text chat

### Activity

1. **Select your persona:** Select a persona that you have created earlier. Go over this person's goals, values and what makes them stressed.

2. **Choose a scenario to walk through:**  Choose something that starts before interacting with your project.  If you have an application, don't start at logging in, instead start at the motive that would make someone need to log in.

For example, if you have an application that provides a taxi service, you could start the user journey with the persona needing to get to a specific location: "Lila needs to get to the airport and her flight leaves in 2 hours."

3. **Write out steps:** Now that you have the scenario, go step by step until your persona completes their task.
By walking through the scenario you might come up with problems you never accounted for otherwise. What if Lila has bad cell coverage? Will your account creation process add to her stress?  How will she know when the car has arrived? How will she know her ETA for getting to the airport?  What other things are important to Lila in this particular scenario.

4. **Ask for feedback** Get feedback on journey maps! Other people might come up with things you didn't account for.  It's good to be prepared before you start making wireframes and prototyping. Remember to tweet @bocoup #opendesignkit
