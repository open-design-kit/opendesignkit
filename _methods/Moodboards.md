## Why use or do it:

Conducting visual research using the words from the [Experience Attribute](/methods/experience-attributes/) activity helps set the stage for exploring visual studies in a later phase. Moodboards also help us start a conversation with the stakeholders about what the project could look like and to make sure their expectations are met in an early stage.

## Who’s involved:

Designers and stakeholders. This could be done in collaboration with the stakeholders as part of the [Visual Design Workshop](/methods/visual-design-workshop/) or as an activity that the designer(s) work on separately and present to the stakeholders before moving on to the visual studies.

## When to use it:

Right after the [Experience Attributes](/methods/experience-attributes/) activity and before starting work on any type of visual studies (aka style tiles and mockups).

## How To:


1. **Gather experience attributes:**Using the words gathered from the [Experience Attributes](https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/wiki/experience-attributes) and [Clustering activities](https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/wiki/sticky-clustering), start searching the web for images that represent feelings associated with those words. The images can be poetic (example: a rainbow or a flower) or more literal (example: a GUI).

2.**Organize your findings:** Place the images in a document and organize them in a way that makes sense for you. As an alternative to using an image editing software, you can use an [inVision board](http://blog.invisionapp.com/boards-share-design-inspiration-assets/) or even [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/)

3. ** Incorporate experience attributes:**You can also incorporate the words you used in order to reference the images.

4. **Share your moodboard:**Save and share your collection with the stakeholders and pay attention to their reaction, that way you'll get a sense if you've taken the right path or you need to continue exploring other ideas before moving on to the visual studies. The moodboard is a great tool to support conversations about what "feels right" for the project.
