## Why do it:

Many Icebreakers are designed to help a group of people get to know each other, but you can also use icebreaker activities to start thematic discussions, gather Agenda items, facilitate brainstorming or even demo things people are working on. An icebreaker is simply a way to orient a group of people around each other, a project or a strategy.


## When to do it:

This should be done a the very beginning of a workshop, session or project to jumpstart collaboration.

## Whoâ€™s involved:

Everyone who is working on the project

## Time estimate:

Small (10 to 30 minutes)

## One way to do it:

1. Gather a group of people who will be working together in a virtual meeting.

2. Start by telling participants you will be using a little madlib to do introductions. Start by introducing yourself and modeling the activity.

* Say your name
* Say I'm from...
* Say "If you really knew me, you'd know..." and include one quirky or interesting fact about yourself. You might say something like "If you really knew me, you'd know I love to roller skate" or "If you really knew me, you'd know that I want to build Indiana Jones style traps in my yard". 


3. Ask the next person to share something about themselves.

4. When everyone has said a fun fact, you can call out a couple that were interesting and use them to further the conversation.
