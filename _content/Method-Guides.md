We are building a lot of different methods, hopefully they are helpful as you think about design and a process for design in your projects. These methods can be used as you see fit, you donâ€™t need to use them all. Dip in and out and use what you need.

Note: we're still working on filling all of these out, so some of the methods don't have a guide yet. When they do we'll link it up.
