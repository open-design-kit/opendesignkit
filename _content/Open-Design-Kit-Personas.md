## About
Esse cares a lot about her code. She wants it to be QA'd, documented and tested. She lints everything and cares about if others can find it readable. In order to be happy on a project, she needs her client's requirements to be clear.

Since UX is new to Esse, she needs to know what value each exercise provides, so she can tell if she needs it.  She also needs to be able to articulate its value to the client.  She learns through looking at examples and doesn't have experience running collaborative workshops.

## About
Carmen Latte has been working at a consultancy for a few years now and is looking for a change.  Her current company is large and she often feels like she can’t make much of an impact on processes there. She’s been on a few interviews at places that told her design was important to them, but didn’t seem to know how to talk about design.

She heard about Bocoup through twitter and has checked out Jess’ blog posts. She likes the size of the company and from what she’s read about open source, it fits in with her values, but the concept of Open Design is new to her and she’s like to know more.
