##What
An open source toolkit for staff, practitioners and current/potential clients.
The kit will ultimately live online as a website, which includes:
* A process map

* Process for moving from design into development and the back-and-forth that goes along with that 
* Roundup of resources for learning more that are available online.


##Who is ODK designed for?
